# Rick And Morty API test app

## In this mini app I implemented:
 - Character List with "Show more" btn
 - Autocomplete Search
 - Character's profile
 - Facebook Login 

## Issues (Most due to fixed time)

### Search bar has some issues that due to time limit I couldn't finish:
- On item select the array of data doesn't stay filtered
- On page change the selected value doesn't change

### I did not use Redux, so the data is fetched in every component that need It which is most likely bad for optimization.

### In Search bar, the pages fetch uses a hard-coded number of pages.
